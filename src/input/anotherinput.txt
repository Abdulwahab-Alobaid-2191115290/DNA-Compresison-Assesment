DNA compression involves reducing the size of DNA sequences for
efficient storage, processing, and transmission. Given the vast amount of genetic information contained
within DNA, advanced algorithms are employed to identify and exploit patterns, repetitions, and redundancies
within the sequences. This not only facilitates faster data handling but also aids in the cost-effective management
of genomic data, which is crucial for various applications in bioinformatics, genomics research,
and personalized medicine. By compressing DNA data, researchers can more easily share and analyze genetic
information, paving the way for advancements in understanding genetic diseases and developing targeted therapies.
